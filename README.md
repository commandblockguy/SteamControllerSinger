commandblockguy's fork of [SteamControllerSinger](https://gitlab.com/Pilatomic/SteamControllerSinger)

Adds the -e flag, which allows you to export a binary for use with my [player for a graphing calculator](https://github.com/commandblockguy/steam-controller-ce).

For best results, use a program such as MidiEditor to split a file into two channels (one for each haptic motor).

CURRENT ISSUES:

Even with the -e flag, a controller or dongle must be attached, and you must wait for the song to convert.
